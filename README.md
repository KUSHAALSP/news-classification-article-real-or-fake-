**📰 Fake News Detection using NLP**:



🔹This project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing techniques. Using a labeled dataset collected from Kaggle, we preprocess the text with NLTK (removing stopwords, stemming, etc.), convert it into numerical form using TF-IDF vectorization, and train a Logistic Regression model. The model is then deployed using Streamlit, providing a simple user interface where anyone can input a news statement and get an instant prediction. This helps demonstrate how machine learning can assist in identifying misinformation in real-world news content.

**🎯 Objective:**


🔹 Classify news articles as fake or real based on their content using NLP and a machine learning model trained on a labeled dataset.


**🛠 Tools & Technologies**


🔹 Python

🔹 Pandas, NumPy

🔹 Scikit-learn

🔹 NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

🔹 Streamlit



**🚀 How to Run Locally**

Run the Streamlit app:


🔹streamlit run app.pystreamlit run app.py



**🔹Output:**


🔹A clean web interface where users can paste any news article and check if it’s likely REAL ✅ or FAKE ❌.
